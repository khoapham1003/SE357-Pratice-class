1. When choosing a requirements engineering tool, consider its functionality, ease of use, scalability, integration capabilities, collaboration features, customization options, vendor support, cost, security, and user feedback. These criteria will help you select a tool that meets your requirements effectively.
2. Drawbacks of requirements engineering tools: complexity, excessive features, cost implications, compatibility limitations, and vendor dependency.
3.When selecting an open-source requirements engineering tool, look for an active community, clear documentation, customization options, compatibility with other tools, stability, security, available support channels, and opportunities for community contributions.
4.Tools enable distributed, global requirements engineering by offering collaboration features, version control, communication channels, traceability, and virtual meeting capabilities.
Drawbacks include communication challenges, technical difficulties, lack of face-to-face interaction, internet dependency, and security concerns. Mitigating these issues requires clear communication channels, training, support, and addressing security measures
